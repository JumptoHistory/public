# Alaska Democrat Favicon

## Brought to you by the [AK Young Demos](http://youngdemos.org)

Having seen a need for a "default" favicon to use with AK Democrat projects,
we decided to create one that anyone who wants to be associated with Alaska
democrats may use, in the spirit of [the JavaScript logo](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js). This icon is meant to be a sort of generic signal of Alaskan
progressivism, and does not directly represent the Alaska Democrat Party, the
Alaska Young Democrats, or any particular candidate, committee or organization.

Enjoy!

### Paid For by the Alaska Young Democrats. Not Authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee.
