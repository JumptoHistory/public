- [x] demo reading a toml config from ~/.config xdg etc
- [x] write something that parses the autostart directory
- [x] write something that can spawn/monitor processes based on twisted's procmon
- [x] patch twisted support into ipython's autoawait
- [x] investigate adding magics to run a non-awaiting result inside crochet's thread in jupyter/ipython
- [x] spin crochet magics out into a separate repo w/ a proper ipython-compatible license
- [x] write an api client and tools in jupyter to interact w/ dbus
- [x] write missing gshell function and spin out into separate repo w/ a proper glib-compatible license
- [x] write executor abstraction for running commands and desktop applications
- [x] write urwid app that will load and display the xdg menu and launch those applications in the background
- [x] write code for loading xdg mime data
- [x] generalize autostart loading code to also work with `xdg.BaseDirectory.load_data_paths('applications')` for the purposes of an applications database to x-ref with mime data
- [x] write code that will load an application database from /usr/share/applications and ~/.local/share/applications and stuff
- [x] make urwid stuff actually work
- [x] POC launcher for default applications
- [x] write dbus marshalling framework
- [x] now make it support properties and events/signals
- [x] build out logging framework
- [x] clean up obvious spelling/formatting issues with gshell and rename LICENSE to COPYING
- [x] make kbmenu work well, be self-documenting, exit on q, etc
- [x] write wrapper for journalctl for loading korbenware logs
- [ ] create a dbus service for executing and monitoring programs with queries for state and soft exit (don't load autostart for now)
- [ ] write tooling for editing local desktop entries and mime/defaults data
- [ ] make kbopen display a menu when there is no default but there are registered apps for that type
- [ ] build up templates and tooling for rendering `_repr_markdown_` representations of the config for inspection in nteract
- [ ] implement dbus activation as necessary
- [ ] load autostart registry into an executor
- [ ] add kb-session to my xinitrc (manually activate the conda env)
- [ ] make toml thinger for configuring running the window manager as a special process
- [ ] switch completely to using korbenware
- [ ] theme urwid components
- [ ] Add license headers to files - most of them will be MPL
- [ ] set up a PKGBUILD that will build and install globally
- [ ] document everything (sphinx, RTD, man pages)
- [ ] integrate other desktop tools as appropriate
