# openscad-fillets

A collection of fillet primitives for openscad.

## install

    wget https://raw.github.com/jesusabdullah/openscad-fillets/master/fillets.scad

## use

In openscad:

    use <fillets.scad>

I haven't tested this yet, but it's how it *should* work.

## docs

The module's very small and has comments. Will do real docs when this has had more use.

## bugs

A number of these fillets should be translated slightly for easier positioning.
