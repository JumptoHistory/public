Every semester, at UAF, the students fill out bubble sheets describing their experiences in each class.  I learned this semester that reports from the data are actually publically available! So, I went to the ASUAF department office and got myself hooked up with the last five years of reports!

Unfortunately, I don't really know what to do with it. SOMEONE *cough* should scrape and make some sweet visualizations or something. :)
