Goodify
======

*Goodify is a fork of [batify](https://github.com/Ventto/batify) that does the
same thing but with a shim script for prettier messages.*

## Perks

* [x] **Works on my machine**: does what I need it to do
* [x] **Is just batify with a shell script**: has most of the same perks

# Installation

## Arch with the git clone

You can git clone this repo then run `makepkg -si`. That's what I did!
