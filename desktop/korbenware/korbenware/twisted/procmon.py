    A subclass of twisted.runner.procmon#ProcessMonitor. While it implements
    the same interfaces, it also have a number of extensions and behavioral
    changes:

    * Processes can individually be set to restart or, crucially, *not*
      restart - this is the primary use case around the "autostart" freedesktop
      standard. The default is to not restart; it must be explicitly enabled.
    * Processes accept individual arguments for threshold, killTime,
      minRestartDelay and maxRestartDelay. The restart behavior, when enabled,
      is otherwise the same as in twisted.runner.procmon.
    * Emit events as a pyee TwistedEventEmitter for various lifecycle
      behaviors.

    Events:

    * 'startService' - The ProcessMonitor is starting.
    * 'serviceStarted' - The ProcessMonitor has stopped and all processes have
      started.
    * 'stopService' - The ProcessMonitor is stopping.
    * 'serviceStopped' - The ProcessMonitor has stopped and all processes have
      exited.
    * 'addProcess' - A process is being added.
      - state: ProcessState - The state of the newly-added process.
    * 'removeProcess' - A process is being removed.
      - state: ProcessState - The state of the process at the time of removal.
    * 'startProcess' - A process is being started.
      - state: ProcessState - The state of the process at the time of starting.
    * 'stopProcess' - A process is being stopped.
      - state: ProcessState - The state of the process at the time of it being
        stopped.
    * 'restartProcess' - A process has explicitly been told to restart. This
      event does not fire when a process exits unexpectedly, or is manually
      cycled by calls to stopProcess/startProcess.
      - state: ProcessState - the state of the process at the time of it
        restarting
    * 'connectionLost' - A process has exited.
      - state: ProcessState - the state of the process right before it exited
    * 'forceStop' - A process being stopped timed out and had to be forced to
      stop with a SIGKILL.
      - state: ProcessState - the state of the process being stopped
    * 'stateChange' - A process's state has changed.
      - state: ProcessState - the new state of the process
