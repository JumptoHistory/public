# This script is a modified version of xorg-xinit's default xinitrc:
#
# https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/xinit/-/blob/master/xinitrc.cpp
#
# It uses the same overall logic as a default xinitrc but with the following
# differences:
#
# - Instead of starting example programs, calls "env" to dump it to stdout
# - Supports loading X profiles
