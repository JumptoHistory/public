        "An [IPython](https://ipython.org/) extension that uses [crochet](https://github.com/itamarst/crochet) to enable running [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/) in IPython and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.\n",

        "\n",
        "Traditionally, the IPython REPL has only truly supported synchronous code. However, IPython [shipped support for running coroutines](https://blog.jupyter.org/ipython-7-0-async-repl-a35ce050f7f7) late last year with support for [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html), [curio](https://github.com/dabeaz/curio) and [trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio), which is really cool! Unfortunately, it has some limitations.\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, code deemed to be running in an async format is ran by [taking a paused/not-running event loop, running it long enough to execute the async code, and then pausing the loop](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/async_helpers.py#L28). This isn't an unreasonable implementation given that IPython was (as far as I know) not originally factored to run async code at all. It does, however, put us in a bind, because if you try to start the Twisted event loop a second time it will [yell at you and refuse](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/blob/8d18e4f83105822a6bad3698eb41ff2f35d56042/src/twisted/internet/error.py#L419). This is because in a typical application an event loop is kept running throughout the lifetime of that process.\n",

        "## A Partial Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "[Crochet](https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a library that runs the Twisted reactor in a thread. This ends up being very handy, because our runner implementation ends up being a call to [`ensureDeferred`](https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/api/twisted.internet.defer.ensureDeferred.html) wrapped in the [`wait_for`](https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#wait-for-blocking-calls-into-twisted) decorator. This means that we can [set up](https://crochet.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#setup) Crochet on extension initialiation, register a small runner to the autoawait magic, and have `%autoawait` support in twisted. In addition, because the loop continues to run in the background, backgrounded tasks will still run once the cell is finished executing. Great!\n",

In addition, it allows for taking the end result of a wrapped block (which must use the `return` keyword unlike regular cells) and making the crochet `EventualResult` object available in the namespace.
