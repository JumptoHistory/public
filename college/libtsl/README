libtsl contains objects and scripts and stuff from ME 415 - Thermal Systems
Laboratory.

My original goal was to build up a single-file library (libtsl.py) that would have everything I ever used in it. I ran into 2 problems with that:

1) I quickly because bothered by the original layout of everything I did, but am way too lazy to rewrite everything when I'm barely reusing any code anyway.

2) I decided to write code I needed for the class in obscure languages in order to be obnoxious (lolcode, "like, python," etc).

The lolcode needs a lolcode interpreter--I used my modified version, but the original, which I forked from, should work fine because I didn't use any of the things I added (powr and lolg).
